# Updates-0.2

## Development paused
I'm taking a break from developing this software for now.
Not sure if I will continue or not.

## Launcher and version control system deleted
It may be considered to add them again in future versions, but they are deleted for now.

## Artificial intelligence operator connected
An artificial intelligence named "HLE" was connected.
Topics such as what it will do will find results up to version 0.3.
It will probably continue to be developed.
Full access to the feature will be available in my version 0.3

## spoiler
I'm planning different language options to come in 1.0 version
